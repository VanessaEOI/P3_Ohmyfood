## OpenClassrooms Project 3

For this third project with OpenClassrooms, the goal was to start using SASS and to develop our skills on CSS effects.

This time I was provided with a site model for mobil first integration and I was free to adapt the website for desktop and tablets use as I juged appropriate.

As always, all the pages must be W3C compliant and compatible with Chrome and Firefox.

**The following CSS effects were imposed :**

 - Buttons hover
 - Gradient hover on "like" icons
 - Loading spinner
 - and on the menu pages, the apparition of the "check icon" on hover
